# TAWBA: Senegal's Development Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

TAWBA is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing and predicting the development trends of Senegal. It leverages key socio-economic indicators, such as GDP, HDI, literacy rates, and more, to provide insights into the country's growth trajectory. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning models to predict future development trends.

## Data Sources

The project uses the following data sources:

- **World Bank**: GDP per Capita, GDP Growth Rate, Inflation Rate.
- **UNESCO**: Literacy Rate.
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Life Expectancy.
- **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**: Human Development Index (HDI).
- **African Development Bank**: Various development indicators for Senegal.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Virtual environment (venv)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdoul84/tawba.git
    cd tawba
    ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up API Keys**:
    - Place your API keys in a `.env` file in the root directory for secure access.

### Usage

#### Data Collection

Run the `data_pipeline.py` script to collect and preprocess the data:
```bash
python src/data_pipeline.py
```

#### Analysis and Modeling

Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data exploration and model building:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb
```

#### Model Evaluation

Evaluate the machine learning models using the `modeling.ipynb` notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/modeling.ipynb
```
